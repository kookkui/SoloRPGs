    desc: "After a successful Bite attack the target must succeed on a CON saving throw (TN 10) or become petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is Paralyzed. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours."

description: "Small land-dwelling birds that look closer to lizards, cockatrices are a feared species due to its extremely foul temper and aggressive behavior, even against an opponent several times their size. Their feathers are extremely precious to some Earth Ara paths though due to their natural affinity with that type of Ara."
