description: "While the origin of these twisted and ever-changing creatures is unknown, it is clear they are not native to any region known to man. Somewhat weak in their infancy, they survive by hunting in groups which decrease in number as they age, as they betray their own and devour one another. The survivor will then become a terrifying (and lethal) sight for anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path."
