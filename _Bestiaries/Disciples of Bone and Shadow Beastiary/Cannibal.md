description: "Life is harsh in the Whiteteeth Peninsula, and many of its inhabitants cannot cope with the pressure. The lands are filled with deranged, dangerous people who sometimes group together, casting most of their humanity aside. These quasi-bestial individuals are feared by all due to their unpredictability, relentlessness, and viciousness, and taste for human flesh. There are rumors of cannibal cults in remote areas, but no proof of any organized groups has been found so far."
