description: "Shadow Hounds are terrible servants of the Tyrants, unleashed upon the world to do their bidding. Sometimes they are seen dragging their victims back to a Fortress other times they simply tear to pieces anything that crosses their path. With their bluish hue and smooth, eyeless face, these beasts are clearly foreign to this world."
