description: "Coming across the path of someone who's walking the path of the Primordial Ones is never good news. It may be someone who has just started their path towards damnation, or it may be someone who has been corrupted for years and no longer sees other humans as their kin; whatever the case, these power-hungry individuals are usually bad news, and one can expect to feel their wrath if their demands are not met."
