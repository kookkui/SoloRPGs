## Skills
- **Alchemy** (INT): This skill allows a character to craft potions, poisons, and other useful concoctions, provided they have access to the right equipment and ingredients.
- **Forbidden Lore**: Knowledge of the Primordial Ones, their servants, and their powers. Sometimes you'll need to understand the motivations and machinations of the Sunken Powers to be able to resist them... or become one with them.
- **Traditional Lore** (20): This skill allows a character to know about a place's history and customs, or to have a general idea of Uzrun's history.

## Advanced Skills

- **Blood Magic** (2 EP): Characters start with a score of WIL x2 when choosing this skill. By sacrificing 1 HP to the Sunken Powers, a Blood Mage may double the effectiveness of any spell. This only applies to spells that may benefit from such an increase; for example, Cauterize will heal 2D10+Level, up from 1D10+L, but a spell like Cleanse Potion cannot be improved with Blood Magic. Blood Magic spells cannot be empowered further with this skill though.
- **Concussive Shot** (2 EP, Hunter exclusive): Characters start with a score of DEX x2 when choosing this skill. The character shoots a skillfully aimed arrow, immediately stunning the target for 2 turns.
- **Death Magic**: Characters start with a score of WIL+INT when choosing this skill. It allows the character to cast powerful death magic spells.
- **Point Blank Shot** (2 EP): A character starts with a value equal to their DEX in this skill. This skill allows the character to shoot with a ranged weapon while in melee range. Prerequisite: Only available to players with 60 or more in the Ranged Weapons skill.

## Corruption

- Corruption rules will remain mostly the same all of this will carry over. 
- Max Corruption determines how many Corruption Points (CP) you can accumulate before your character is lost to the Primordial Ones. A character is considered dead when their Corruption equals their Max Corruption. We will talk in detail about corruption in the section of this book dedicated to magic and spells. **New characters start with a Max Corruption of 10.**
