>> - All normal rules apply as usual however in order to have a spell inscribed into your grimoire for future reference (and is now required to learn spells) you must seek out a Scribe in a settlement.
>> - Since Magic is taboo not every settlement would have someone skilled or willing to perform this service. When you get to a settlement there is a *50% chance* there is a Scribe working in that settlement.
>> - Finding them and getting them to preform the service might take some charm or possibly preforming a quest or mission for them.
