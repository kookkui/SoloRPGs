##### Mission: The Village elder wants me to retrieve an Ancient Relic from an old Mine 24 miles to the North from here.

This will prove I am old enough to set out on my own...

### First Watch

Setting out North to try and find the Mine.

Survival Check(34) `d100 = 21` Success!

Next Hex Forest (+1 Watch)

Hex exploration Check 

**Nest**. Woven with tree trunks and large vines, a nest big enough to hold several people rests against a small rock formation ahead of you. Approaching it with caution, you find the remains of three enormous eggs, cracked shell pieces flooring the nest's bottom. Perform a Perception skill test, if you succeed you find 10 precious gemstones worth 50 jats each scattered between the shells

Perception Check (56) `d100 = 50` Success!

+10 precious gemstones(50 jats each)

### Second Watch

The forest is a bit thick so getting through this might take a bit longer than I hoped.

Encounter Check: Nothing.

I will keep pressing on until I reach the mine...

### Third Watch

I have arrived at the Mystical Mines, this is where the Ancient Relic was said to be.

## Mystical Mines
