Traveling due east still...

### Third Watch

I just want to get out of this horrible swamp so I have decided to press on a little longer and try to get to a clearing...

+1 Encounter Penalty 

Encounter Check: `d8 = 7` Nothing.
### Forth Watch

Finally out of the swamp and in a forest that is at least dry. Seems this forest is very old these trees are massive.

I wonder if there is a somewhere I can rest safely for the night without making camp, I am so exhausted...Yes, but its not as safe as a rock cave but its a hollowed out tree. This will do for the rest of the night.
