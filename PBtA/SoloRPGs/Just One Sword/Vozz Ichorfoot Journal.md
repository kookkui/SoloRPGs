### Forth Watch

Encounter Check +1: `d8 = 1` Encounter!

Witch, Oppression, Scavenging, Hungry

I notice a Witch, grumbling to herself and searching around in the near-by brush. I call out and wave at showing no hostility.

Reaction: Neutral / Indifferent 

I offer the Witch a ration and she gladly accepts. 

Seeing as I only have 5 silver to my name I decided it would be easier to just be on my way rather than barter with the Witch. 

I found a Hidden Homestead, I wonder if anyone is living here? 

Seems it is abandoned, I will just rest here for the night.
