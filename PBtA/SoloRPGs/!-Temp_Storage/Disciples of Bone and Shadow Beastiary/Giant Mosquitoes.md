description: "These ever-present pests, the size of fists, are found in all corners of the Whiteteeth Peninsula, where they feed on any living creature they can find. They swarm their victims with a ferocity rarely seen on a creature their size, especially right after a big storm. The worst part is that their bite can transmit a particularly nasty disease that rots the flesh, this being the reason why they are killed on sight by any sane person."
