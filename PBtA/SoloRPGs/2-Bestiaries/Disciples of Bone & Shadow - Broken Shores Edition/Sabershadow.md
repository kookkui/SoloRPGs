description: "*Sabershadows are fierce cat-like predators, the size of a large dog. They are solitary hunters that can stalk their prey for miles, waiting for the right moment to attack. They are relentless when they do so, and their enormous fangs can pierce through the strongest of armors without a problem.*"
