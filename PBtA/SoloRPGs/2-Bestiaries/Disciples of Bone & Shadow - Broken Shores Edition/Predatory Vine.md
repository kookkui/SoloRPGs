    desc: "Roll a D10 every turn: on a roll of 1-2, the Predatory Vine attempts to entangle a random character instead of attacking. The character performs a **Coordination** Test. If they fail, they are trapped and cannot attack, and the Predatory Vine will focus on the other characters. Each turn, the trapped character may roll **Demanding Coordination** Test (-10) to release themselves. If all characters become trapped, the Predatory Vine will attack them until they are all dead. While trapped, characters may not use defensive skills, only armor bonuses are applied."

description: "*Only found in the deepest and darkest of marshes and swamps, these deadly plants feed on any living creature foolish enough to approach their ordinary-looking leaves and vines. Sensing their prey through the vibrations caused by passing nearby, these plants will immediately shoot their vines, acting as tentacles that will strangle and constrict the hapless victim, until it can be slowly absorbed by it.*"
