description: "*White Hags are twisted, old female looking humans that have succumbed to madness after decades of being exposed to the Forbidden Ones' powers. They are rarely seen, but legends speak of old, wrinkly women walking completely naked despite the cold, their long, white hair flowing behind them as if it had a mind of its own. In combat, a White Hag will kneel and crawl instead of walking, while her hair shoots at her enemies, strangling and piercing them until none remain.*"
