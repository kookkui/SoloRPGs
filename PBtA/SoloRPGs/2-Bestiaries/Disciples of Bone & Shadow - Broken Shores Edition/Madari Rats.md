description: "*These giant rats were originally bred at the Madari Arena, hundreds of years ago. They were used to feed the giant lizards and other beasts that fought in forced combat during the reign of Ghatr the Execrable. Following the destruction of Madari, they escaped and have since thrived all over the region and beyond.*"
