description: "*A Blessed One is a true disciple of the Primordial Ones, an acolyte of the dark powers, slave to their own ambition. Their mind is fragmented but the pieces are still threaded together, leaving a sliver of humanity. These are some of the most dangerous spellcasters a person will find during their travels, and are commonly used by the Primordial Ones as agents when direct, decisive action is required.*"
