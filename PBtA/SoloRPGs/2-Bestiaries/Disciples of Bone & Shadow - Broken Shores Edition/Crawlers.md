description: "*These armored beasts like to hide in dark, closed places like ruins and caves, where they find mosses and other vegetable matter to eat. Extremely territorial, they will immediately charge anyone or anything that comes near them. Their giant pincers can tear apart a grown man in minutes, so travelers tend to simply run away instead of confronting them.*"
