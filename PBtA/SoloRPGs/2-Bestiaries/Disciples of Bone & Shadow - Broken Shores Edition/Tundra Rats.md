description: "*Larger than the more common Madari rats, these hairy cousins of the common rat have evolved to become perfectly adapted to the harsh environment of the Whiteteeth Peninsula. They hunt in small groups, ferociously taking down any prey they find, even though they are predominantly scavengers and will run away from a fight as soon as things get ugly.*"
