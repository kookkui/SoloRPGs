description: "*The crocodiles found in Deathrot Marsh are enormous, ancient beasts that can wait immobile for days or even weeks, waiting for their next unsuspecting meal. They have the almost supernatural ability to sense any living thing in a ten feet radius, making it extremely difficult to simply walk past them. Once they've smelled blood they enter a frenzy that only ends with the prey's or the crocodile's death.*"
