description: "*Terrifying and deadly, these three-eyed birds of prey hunt always in pairs; while one harasses their chosen prey from the front the other one attacks from behind, usually finishing the job. Their large size (as tall as a standing man) allows them to go after all types of prey, including unsuspected humans.*"
