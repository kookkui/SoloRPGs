description: "*Some sorcerers transcend their own death using the power of the Primordial Ones, instead of embracing the power of Death Magic. Most of the time though, the result is a mindless abomination left only with the desire to drain the life force of any creature that crosses its path. These sorcerers though still pose a large threat due to their power to raise other creatures into the undead, often creating large armies of mindless monsters and setting them lose upon the world. It is not unheard of a settlement being wiped out in a moment by a large roaming group of undead, led by a Bonefiend.*"
