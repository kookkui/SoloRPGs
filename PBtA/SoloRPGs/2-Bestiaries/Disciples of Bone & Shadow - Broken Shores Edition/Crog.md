description: "*Rumored to be the result of one of Urthan Fleshwarper's many experiments, Crogs are humanoid creatures covered in pustules and decaying flesh. They are not always prone to violence but are easily scared, resulting in them attacking almost any living creature that happens to startle them. They seem to be content sitting on the floor while peeling away sections of their own decaying flesh.*"
