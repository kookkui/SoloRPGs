description: "Glacial Bears are among the top predators in the Whiteteeth Peninsula; very few creatures will not immediately run away at the sight of these beasts. This is generally a futile endeavor though due to their surprising speed despite their impressive size. With claws the size of a man's head, a single swing is generally enough to tear apart anything (or anyone) stupid enough to face them."
