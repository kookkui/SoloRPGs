|`dice:d10`|Site Expedition - Door Type|
|---|---|
|1|**ALARM DOOR**: Tampering with this door will trigger a silent alarm. A Perception check is required to detect the alarm and a Technology check is required to turn it off. Failure to pick the lock or disable the alarm will trigger an Encounter.|
|2|**DREAD DOOR**: Something feels wrong about this door—your head feels dizzy when you look at it. Characters must pass a Resolve check to interact with it.|
|3|**HEART DOOR**: Crossing this door’s threshold causes all characters to become Composed.|
|4|**SECURE DOOR**: A particularly difficult door. When attempting to open it with a LKPK, roll two Access Node dice and pick the worse result.|
|5|**FLAME DOOR**: This door’s threshold has extra security measures. When crossed, a sheet of intense flames jets from the top. This requires a Perception check to detect and a Technology check to disarm.|
|6|**MIND DOOR**: Upon crossing this door’s threshold, it becomes patent that this was not meant for a human mind. A sharp psychic pain strikes all characters (+`dice:d20` Stress), leaving them convulsing until they can crawl away from the door.|
|7|**ELECTRIC FIELD DOOR**: This door has a powerful electric field which causes batteries to explode. Upon crossing its threshold, a random character loses 1xBattery and receives `dice:d10` damage.|
|8|**FLESH DOOR**: A mass of fleshy matter blocks the way, with only a valve-like orifice allowing passage through. Squeezing through is not actually difficult, but the experience causes all characters to gain `dice:d4` Stress.|
|9|**ONE WAY DOOR**: This innocuous threshold allows characters to cross it in one direction, but a force field blocks any attempts to cross back through it.|
|10|**STANDARD DOOR**: A normal door made of strong metal.|
