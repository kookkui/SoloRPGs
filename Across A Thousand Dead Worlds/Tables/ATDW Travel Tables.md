|9|Space Anomaly Travel Event: The ship shakes during warp travel. All crew members must pass a DEX check to strap themselves in time, or suffer 1 Wound due to the violence of the event.|
|10|Space Anomaly Travel Event: With a loud groan, the ship drops out of warpspace as if it had been pulled. The ship’s lights flicker within the silence of space.
