| 20-22       | The sea is shallow here, so much so that you can see the bottom. Deep down you spot the unique shine of some shards, half buried in the sand. If you attempt to swim to the bottom and grab a few you must perform an Athletics check; success means you find D20 shards. Each attempt requires you to make a new encounter check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23-25       | The remains of a wreckage fill the area. You recover D10+5 Crafting Supplies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26-30       | You found a derelict. Use the derelict creation tables if you decide to explore it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31-33       | A floating shrine to Aphion, Goddess of the Sea. Offering a shard allows you to reroll on this table the next time you get a complication result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34-36       | The ocean is putrid here; maybe it’s some sort of natural pestilence, a cursed patch of ocean floor that affects the area, toxic seaweed, or something more sinister. Regardless of the cause, remaining here requires a Vitality check every hour; failure causes D10 damage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 37-39       | A floating structure made of several makeshift platforms. The four large, blazing torches mark it as the domain of Nirena, Goddess of Death. On each platform you can see several wrapped bodies, eerily untouched by the seagulls and other animals, who would have normally devoured the corpses. If you decide to loot the corpses and offerings roll on the Mundane Loot table, but you must roll D10: a result of 1 means that a Deathless Guardian has awakened and attacks you.                                                                                                            |
| 40-45       | A solitary tower, ascending from the depths of the sea. This was once a lighthouse, or perhaps a fortress’ watchtower; regardless of its original function, enough of it remains above the water to make it worth exploring. Use the ruin generation rules if you choose to take a look inside, the tower has a fixed small (D6) size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46-48       | You see a plume of black smoke in the distance. When you approach, you find the remains of some sort of ship, sinking as it burns with flames that don’t seem to be quenched by the water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 49-51       | A giant, stationary wall of water hundreds of feet tall impedes your progress. You must go around this hex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 52-54       | You find a rather large flask floating in the water. Inside there’s a vellum scroll describing a spell. Roll on the Spells table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 55-57       | The crystalline waters allow you to see a large, intact city at the bottom of the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
