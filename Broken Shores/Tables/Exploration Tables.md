| 20-22       | The sea is shallow here, so much so that you can see the bottom. Deep down you spot the unique shine of some shards, half buried in the sand. If you attempt to swim to the bottom and grab a few you must perform an Athletics check; success means you find D20 shards. Each attempt requires you to make a new encounter check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23-25       | The remains of a wreckage fill the area. You recover D10+5 Crafting Supplies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26-30       | You found a derelict. Use the derelict creation tables if you decide to explore it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31-33       | A floating shrine to Aphion, Goddess of the Sea. Offering a shard allows you to reroll on this table the next time you get a complication result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34-36       | The ocean is putrid here; maybe it’s some sort of natural pestilence, a cursed patch of ocean floor that affects the area, toxic seaweed, or something more sinister. Regardless of the cause, remaining here requires a Vitality check every hour; failure causes D10 damage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 37-39       | A floating structure made of several makeshift platforms. The four large, blazing torches mark it as the domain of Nirena, Goddess of Death. On each platform you can see several wrapped bodies, eerily untouched by the seagulls and other animals, who would have normally devoured the corpses. If you decide to loot the corpses and offerings roll on the Mundane Loot table, but you must roll D10: a result of 1 means that a Deathless Guardian has awakened and attacks you.                                                                                                            |
| 40-45       | A solitary tower, ascending from the depths of the sea. This was once a lighthouse, or perhaps a fortress’ watchtower; regardless of its original function, enough of it remains above the water to make it worth exploring. Use the ruin generation rules if you choose to take a look inside, the tower has a fixed small (D6) size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46-48       | You see a plume of black smoke in the distance. When you approach, you find the remains of some sort of ship, sinking as it burns with flames that don’t seem to be quenched by the water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 49-51       | A giant, stationary wall of water hundreds of feet tall impedes your progress. You must go around this hex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 52-54       | You find a rather large flask floating in the water. Inside there’s a vellum scroll describing a spell.

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-10        | Rats! Rats have snuck onto your vessel and eaten D4 rations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11-20       | Broken part. Something has broken and it must be repaired. Until you do so, reduce your vessel’s Hull by D6 and half its speed. Repairing it requires 3xCrafting Supplies                                                                                                                     |
| 21-30       | Leak. You are treading water; it’s not urgent but if the vessel is not repaired in the next 48 hours, it will be lost. Repairs take D4xCrafting Supplies.                                                                                                                                     |
| 31-40       | Torn sail. The sail is torn and must be fixed. Until then, you move at half the usual speed. Repairs take 1xCrafting Supplies.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 41-50       | Ebon Fin hatchlings. Those damn creatures like attaching themselves to vessels of any type and while they themselves pose no threat, they attract the adults. Removing them requires a successful Athletics check, otherwise the vessel is attacked by an Ebon Fin.                           |
| 51-70       | Reef. Perform a Sailing check successfully or your vessel suffers D6 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 71-80       | Giant Wave. A wave the size of a mountain threatens to turn your vessel into splinters. Perform a successful Sailing check to ride it, or your vessel receives D20 damage.                                                                                                                    |
| 81-90       | Sandbar. Your vessel becomes grounded on a shallow part of the sea, unless you succeed at a Sailing check. If grounded, you must wait D6 hours for the tide to rise and be free.                                                                                                              |
| 91-95       | Sea Monster. An abomination from the depths has taken an interest in your vessel. Set a Timer to D6 and make a timer check every round. If you haven’t dealt 20 damage to the creature (enough to show the beast you’re not an easy meal) before the time runs out, your vessel is destroyed. |
| 96-100      | Whirlpool. Furious, spinning waters lie ahead. Set a timer to D6 and make a check every round. If you haven’t succeed at 5 Sailing checks before the time runs out, the vessel is gone, and so are you.                                                                                       |

| 46-60       | You see the remains of an old wreckage, rotten wood and rusted scraps of metal spread around what’s left of the ship’s hull. You find `dice:D6` Crafting Supplies.                                                                                               |     |
| 61-66       | Strange fruit trees tempt you with their glistening, juicy-looking fruits. If you risk taking one, roll `dice:D4`: A result of 1-2 means that the fruit is actually poisonous, and you suffer `dice:D10` damage. Otherwise it’s good to eat, and you gather `dice:D10` Rations |     |
| 67-70       | A distinctive landmark. Roll on the Landmark tables to generate one                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| 71-80       | You find a settlement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| 81-100      | You find some ancient ruins. Use the Ruin generation rules if you decide to explore them                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
