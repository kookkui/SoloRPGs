| 20-22       | The sea is shallow here, so much so that you can see the bottom. Deep down you spot the unique shine of some shards, half buried in the sand. If you attempt to swim to the bottom and grab a few you must perform an Athletics check; success means you find D20 shards. Each attempt requires you to make a new encounter check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23-25       | The remains of a wreckage fill the area. You recover D10+5 Crafting Supplies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26-30       | You found a derelict. Use the derelict creation tables if you decide to explore it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31-33       | A floating shrine to Aphion, Goddess of the Sea. Offering a shard allows you to reroll on this table the next time you get a complication result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34-36       | The ocean is putrid here; maybe it’s some sort of natural pestilence, a cursed patch of ocean floor that affects the area, toxic seaweed, or something more sinister. Regardless of the cause, remaining here requires a Vitality check every hour; failure causes D10 damage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 37-39       | A floating structure made of several makeshift platforms. The four large, blazing torches mark it as the domain of Nirena, Goddess of Death. On each platform you can see several wrapped bodies, eerily untouched by the seagulls and other animals, who would have normally devoured the corpses. If you decide to loot the corpses and offerings roll on the Mundane Loot table, but you must roll D10: a result of 1 means that a Deathless Guardian has awakened and attacks you.                                                                                                            |
| 40-45       | A solitary tower, ascending from the depths of the sea. This was once a lighthouse, or perhaps a fortress’ watchtower; regardless of its original function, enough of it remains above the water to make it worth exploring. Use the ruin generation rules if you choose to take a look inside, the tower has a fixed small (D6) size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46-48       | You see a plume of black smoke in the distance. When you approach, you find the remains of some sort of ship, sinking as it burns with flames that don’t seem to be quenched by the water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 49-51       | A giant, stationary wall of water hundreds of feet tall impedes your progress. You must go around this hex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 52-54       | You find a rather large flask floating in the water. Inside there’s a vellum scroll describing a spell.

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-10        | Rats! Rats have snuck onto your vessel and eaten D4 rations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11-20       | Broken part. Something has broken and it must be repaired. Until you do so, reduce your vessel’s Hull by D6 and half its speed. Repairing it requires 3xCrafting Supplies                                                                                                                     |
| 21-30       | Leak. You are treading water; it’s not urgent but if the vessel is not repaired in the next 48 hours, it will be lost. Repairs take D4xCrafting Supplies.                                                                                                                                     |
| 31-40       | Torn sail. The sail is torn and must be fixed. Until then, you move at half the usual speed. Repairs take 1xCrafting Supplies.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 41-50       | Ebon Fin hatchlings. Those damn creatures like attaching themselves to vessels of any type and while they themselves pose no threat, they attract the adults. Removing them requires a successful Athletics check, otherwise the vessel is attacked by an Ebon Fin.                           |
| 51-70       | Reef. Perform a Sailing check successfully or your vessel suffers D6 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 71-80       | Giant Wave. A wave the size of a mountain threatens to turn your vessel into splinters. Perform a successful Sailing check to ride it, or your vessel receives D20 damage.                                                                                                                    |
| 81-90       | Sandbar. Your vessel becomes grounded on a shallow part of the sea, unless you succeed at a Sailing check. If grounded, you must wait D6 hours for the tide to rise and be free.                                                                                                              |
| 91-95       | Sea Monster. An abomination from the depths has taken an interest in your vessel. Set a Timer to D6 and make a timer check every round. If you haven’t dealt 20 damage to the creature (enough to show the beast you’re not an easy meal) before the time runs out, your vessel is destroyed. |
| 96-100      | Whirlpool. Furious, spinning waters lie ahead. Set a timer to D6 and make a check every round. If you haven’t succeed at 5 Sailing checks before the time runs out, the vessel is gone, and so are you.                                                                                       |

| 37-40       | You stumble upon a hidden cave, no more than a few feet deep. Inside, you find some crates. Roll on the Valuable Loot table                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41-45       | Magic in the area behaves strangely. Roll D6: 1-3 +30 to Spell Effect rolls, 4-6 -30 to Spell Effect rolls                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 46-60       | You see the remains of an old wreckage, rotten wood and rusted scraps of metal spread around what’s left of the ship’s hull. You find `dice:D6` Crafting Supplies.                                                                                                             |
| 61-66       | Strange fruit trees tempt you with their glistening, juicy-looking fruits. If you risk taking one, roll `dice:D4`: A result of 1-2 means that the fruit is actually poisonous, and you suffer `dice:D10` damage. Otherwise it’s good to eat, and you gather `dice:D10` Rations |
| 67-70       | A distinctive landmark. Roll on the Landmark tables to generate one                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 71-80       | You find a settlement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 81-100      | You find some ancient ruins. Use the Ruin generation rules if you decide to explore them                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | A random character is assaulted by terrible visions: incomprehensible creatures emerge from the walls, leaving bloody trails in their wake. The character must pass a Tenacity check or see their WIL reduced by -1 for the next 24 hours                                                                                                           |
| 2          | Strange growth covers this room, a moss-like tumor the color of rotten leaves that is somehow corroding everything in its wake! Characters must make a Coordination check or lose a random piece of gear                                                                                                                                            |
| 3          | A throne-shaped structure has been erected in the middle of this room, made entirely of different kinds of bones. If a character decides to sit, roll `dice:d10`: 1-5 a random skill is increased by +1, 6-10 they lose 5 HP                                                                                                                        |
| 4          | This section’s floor has completely crumbled away, revealing a deep black hole below. Characters must find a way around it or jump over it if they want to continue through this room                                                                                                                                                               |
| 5          | A sudden flash flood rushes through the room. Characters must pass a Brawn check to hold onto something or be tossed around pretty badly, losing `dice:d10` HP                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6          | A random character gets the very strong impression they are being followed. Is it true, though?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 7          | Right as the characters enter this room, they catch a glimpse of someone leaving it. Pursuing results in nothing—did that actually happen, or was it all in their heads?                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8          | A mix of mud and slime covers this unusually warm room, filth dripping from its walls. In the corner, a pile of what appears to be large eggs shivers slightly. Something stirs inside of each egg                                                                                                                                                  |
| 9          | As the characters enter this room, a voice screams in their heads. If they have a piece of blank scroll or somewhere else to write and pass a Literacy check, they manage to record a new spell. Roll on the Spells table                                                                                                                           |
| 10         | Distracted, a random character is bitten on the hand. There’s nothing around, but the bite quickly turns purple. The character must pass a Vitality check or reduce all their skills by -10 until an antidote of any type is used                                                                                                                   |
| 11         | Strange fungi cover this room, bulbous, pale and wet. Walking close to them causes them to burst in a cloud of spores. Characters must pass a Coordination check to avoid the spores, which cause them to forget one of their spells                                                                                                                |
| 12         | This Room’s floor is completely frozen and covered with a sheet of ice, making it difficult to traverse. +1 ET                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 13         | An upper room has collapsed onto this one, revealing a chest. Unfortunately, a character attempting to reach it must hang and swing from different heights and holding spots, requiring 3 consecutively successful Acrobatics checks. If they reach the chest, they can roll on the Valuable Loot table                                             |
| 14         | An absolutely miasmic wave of rotten smell invades the characters’ senses, leaving them confused and requiring time to recover. +1 ET                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 15         | This room is several times taller than the others, with a stela or decorative column in its center. Approaching it has a 50% chance of either granting or consuming 5 PP                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16         | A dull metallic box sits in a corner of this room. About 1 ft tall and deep, it has a clear lid that can be easily opened. There’s a 50% chance opening it reveals a valuable artifact (page 120) and a 50% chance it sets off a sorcerous trap (`dice:d10` damage)                                                                                 |
| 17         | A ladder in this room leads to a hatch in the ceiling. This is a direct exit point from the ruins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18         | A subtle humming can be heard, slowly but surely increasing in intensity. If the characters remain here for longer than a minute, they must pass a Vitality check or take `dice:D4+5`damage and start bleeding from their ears                                                                                                                      |
| 19         | A strange sense of calmness invades all characters who enter this area—the feeling of having recovered a lost, cherished memory. Remaining here for a while (+1 ET) restores `dice:D4`HP and `dice:D6`PP but makes it difficult to leave voluntarily. Characters must pass a Tenacity check to leave, and can only attempt it once every 10 minutes |
| 20         | A bright light burns in the center of this room—like a miniature sun floating upon a pedestal.

| 40-41       | **Intriguing mural:** A once vivid and colorful mural covers the whole wall in front of you. You immediately notice there's something off about it; some pieces seem to be out of place. To your surprise, you can easily slide them around and set them on what you believe to be the right place. Each character may attempt a Intellect check to remember details about the story depicted in the mural and solve it. Solving the puzzle causes a small hidden compartment to open, revealing a cache roll on Valuable Loot.                                                                                                 |

|`dice:d10`|Exploration - Traps|
|---|---|
|1|**Broken arrows corpse:** Arrows shoot from a hidden spot, dealing D10 damage to the character who triggered it.|
|2|**Slightly different floor:** The character steps on a hidden bear trap. They suffer D6 damage and their Speed is reduced by half until the wound is healed. Freeing the trapped character requires a Brawn check, and takes 1 ET|
|3|**None:** A net trap suddenly traps the character, who becomes Entangled. Each attempt at liberating themself (a Demanding task) takes the character 1 ET, unless helped by another character|
|4|**Darts, corpse:** A salvo of small, poisoned darts strike the character, who becomes poisoned unless they pass a Vitality check. The darts deal 1 damage, but the poison deals 2 damage/ET|
|5|**Slightly different floor:** The character falls into a hole, disguised by a trap door. The hole is full of water, and the character must pass an Athletics check to climb out|
|6|**Blood, marked floor:** A swinging blade strikes the character, who must roll on the Slashing Critical Hit table|

|8|**Burn marks, soot:** A ball of fire fills the room, dealing 2D6 damage to all characters|
|9|**Disquieting, tingling sensation:** An alarm of some sort (mechanical, magical, other) attracts the attention of one of the place’s inhabitants. Roll on the appropriate Combat Encounter table|
|10|**Extra dampness:** A rush of water fills the room, while at the same time all access points close. Characters must unlock or break a door (a Hard task) or start Drowning|

| 2          | Collapsing. This place is dangerous to explore, and will not stand for much longer. Each time you enter a new room, roll D10. A result of 1 means a section of the place is falling down, pass a Coordination check or receive D6 damage                                    |
| 3          | Magically Unstable. Sparks of magic energy can be seen lighting the room around you. Each time a spell is cast, roll D4: a result of 1-2 means that you must add +30 to the Spell Effect roll, whereas a result of 3-4 means you must subtract -30 to the Spell Effect roll |
| 4          | Warped Time. There’s something wrong with this place… Each time an Exploration Turn passes, roll D10: a result of 1-5 means it didn’t actually pass                                                                                                                         |
| 5          | Shifting Gravity. This place was strangely affected by the death of the gods. Each time you enter a new room, roll D10. A result of 1 means gravity doesn’t behave as expected there. You must succeed at a Coordination check each time you attempt any action             |
| 6          | Underwater Sections. The sea still holds a claim here. Each time you enter a new room, roll D10. A result of 1-2 means the room is fully submerged                                                                                                                          |
| 7          | Toxic Atmosphere. The air is not fully breathable here; each time you rest you must pass a Vitality check or receive D6 damage                                                                                                                                              |
| 8          | Cursed. You feel unwelcome here, and can hear the dead cursing your name. -10 to all actions                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9          | Hallowed. A sense of calmness invites you here, helping you concentrate. +10 to all checks                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10         | Looted. You’re not the first one to loot this place… Each time you are asked to roll on the common Finds table, do nothing instead                                                                                                                                          |
| 11         | Extreme Heat. This place is a furnace; each time you make a rest you must consume 1xRation or increase your Fatigue level by +1                                                                                                                                             |
| 12         | Overgrown Vegetation. This place is full of plant life, which makes it difficult to see or find anything. Searching a room takes 2 ET, instead of 1                                                                                                                         |
