## The Settlement of Brinemoor

How do they feel about outsiders? Must prove themselves first.

Seems their main industry is hunting and gathering.

Smith is <font color="#A100F2">Master (+3 Max)</font>

They probably have issues with the creatures that welcomed me to the island.

The person in charge is an Overlord named **Bohr**.

Speaking with Bohr I must prove myself before being trusted by him and the village. 

Sophisticated labyrinth
Destroy Religious artifact

Bohr has tasked me with destroying a artifact in a nearby temple of a cult most likely. 

It will take me 6 milestones to get to the location of the temple.
