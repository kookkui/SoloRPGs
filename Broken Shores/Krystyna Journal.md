## The Settlement of Brinemoor

How do they feel about outsiders? Must prove themselves first.

Seems their main industry is hunting and gathering.

Smith is <font color="#A100F2">Master (+3 Max)</font>

They probably have issues with the creatures that welcomed me to the island.

The person in charge is an Overlord named **Bohr**.

Speaking with Bohr I must prove myself before being trusted by him and the village. 

Sophisticated labyrinth
Destroy Religious artifact
### Quest to Destroy Cultists' Tome
Bohr has tasked me with destroying a artifact in a nearby temple of a cult most likely. 

It will take me 6 hexes to get to the location of the temple.

You find some ancient ruins. Use the Ruin generation rules if you decide to explore them

#### Ancient Fortress

As you trudge through the foul smelling swamp an ancient Fortress nestled deep in the bog. You decide to investigate possible treasures, a chill runs up your spine as you make your way inside.

Medium (D8) for size of the fortress. 

Magically Unstable. Sparks of magic energy can be seen lighting the room around you. Each time a spell is cast, roll D4: a result of 1-2 means that you must add +30 to the Spell Effect roll, whereas a result of 3-4 means you must subtract -30 to the Spell Effect roll

**Intriguing mural:** A once vivid and colorful mural covers the whole wall in front of you. You immediately notice there's something off about it; some pieces seem to be out of place. To your surprise, you can easily slide them around and set them on what you believe to be the right place. Each character may attempt a Intellect check to remember details about the story depicted in the mural and solve it. Solving the puzzle causes a small hidden compartment to open, revealing a cache roll on Valuable Loot.
