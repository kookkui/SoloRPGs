###### Ocean Exploration - Findings
The sea is shallow here, so much so that you can see the bottom. Deep down you spot the unique shine of some shards, half buried in the sand. If you attempt to swim to the bottom and grab a few you must perform an Athletics check; success means you find D20 shards. Each attempt requires you to make a new encounter check.
