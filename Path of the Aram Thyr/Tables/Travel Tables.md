### Setting Camp Mishaps


|`dice:d10`|Setting Camp Mishaps|
|---|---|
|1|You are too noisy while setting up camp, attracting some unwanted attention. Roll on the appropriate encounters table|
|2|The campfire goes out when the firewood gets wet or runs out. In order to stave off the effects of the cold, the party must perform a CON Ability check. With the proper cold weather equipment, the characters can add +2 to their CON for the check. Failure results in mild hypothermia and a -2 penalty for D4 days on all rolls|
|3|You set camp over a wet patch of land, without realizing it. You wake up wet and uncomfortable, with damp clothes and gear. You have Disadvantage on all CON-related checks for the next 24 hours, as you feel tired and unrested|
|4|The chosen site is not ideal. Too much wind, exposure to the elements, or some other similar problem means that the camp needs to be moved to a different location. Nobody manages to sleep during this phase, resulting in each character gaining 1 level of Fatigue|
|5|Part of your rations seem to have spoiled. Remove D4 rations|
|6|Water brought by the party or found nearby the camp is contaminated. This phase, the party must spend an additional ration per person to account for it|
|7|A random character has lost a piece of gear and can’t find it no matter how hard they look for it. Determine what has been lost randomly|
|8|The chosen spot seems to somehow be draining your Ara, but you realize too late. All characters lose D10 Ara|
|9|A poorly managed fire spreads out of control and starts neighboring objects on fire. Each character loses a random item in their possession that the fire burns and consumes|
|10|The group makes camp in a small cave. The cave's ceiling partially caves in throughout the night, burying supplies, tents, and characters alike. Each character loses one of the following (pick one): D6 HP, 2xRations, 1xRandom piece of gear. All characters gain 1 level of Fatigue|
