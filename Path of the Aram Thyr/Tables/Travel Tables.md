### Setting Camp Mishaps


|`dice:d10`|Setting Camp Mishaps|
|---|---|
|1|You are too noisy while setting up camp, attracting some unwanted attention. Roll on the appropriate encounters table|
|2|The campfire goes out when the firewood gets wet or runs out. In order to stave off the effects of the cold, the party must perform a CON Ability check. With the proper cold weather equipment, the characters can add +2 to their CON for the check. Failure results in mild hypothermia and a -2 penalty for D4 days on all rolls|
|3|You set camp over a wet patch of land, without realizing it. You wake up wet and uncomfortable, with damp clothes and gear. You have Disadvantage on all CON-related checks for the next 24 hours, as you feel tired and unrested|
|4|The chosen site is not ideal. Too much wind, exposure to the elements, or some other similar problem means that the camp needs to be moved to a different location. Nobody manages to sleep during this phase, resulting in each character gaining 1 level of Fatigue|
|5|Part of your rations seem to have spoiled. Remove D4 rations|
|6|Water brought by the party or found nearby the camp is contaminated. This phase, the party must spend an additional ration per person to account for it|
|7|A random character has lost a piece of gear and can’t find it no matter how hard they look for it. Determine what has been lost randomly|
|8|The chosen spot seems to somehow be draining your Ara, but you realize too late. All characters lose D10 Ara|
|9|A poorly managed fire spreads out of control and starts neighboring objects on fire. Each character loses a random item in their possession that the fire burns and consumes|
|10|The group makes camp in a small cave. The cave's ceiling partially caves in throughout the night, burying supplies, tents, and characters alike. Each character loses one of the following (pick one): D6 HP, 2xRations, 1xRandom piece of gear. All characters gain 1 level of Fatigue|

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | The party runs into some type of encounter. Roll on the appropriate encounter table                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2          | A thick mist appears, reducing visibility to a distance of 15 feet. Overland travel is cut by 1 hex, and by 2 hexes while across a forest                                                                                                                                               |
| 3          | The path ahead is blocked in a way that makes sense for the biome: rocks, downed trees, a flood, a landslide, etc. In order to proceed the characters must overcome the obstacle or circle around the hex in the next phase                                                             |
| 4          | The ground suddenly shifts under the character’s feet, causing them to stumble and fall into the gap below. All characters must perform an Acrobatics check or lose D6 HP due to the fall. Iron and above characters can ignore the damage                                              |
| 5          | A random party member trips and sprains their ankle (unless they’re Iron or above, in which case nothing happens). The affected character must rest for the remainder of the day, and their speed is reduced by half for D4 days.                                                       |
| 6          | It appears the party has been walking in circles, making no progress during this phase                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7          | The characters stumble upon an old hunting ground. Unfortunately for them, the place is still covered in traps, forcing them to reduce their pace to 1 hex in order to avoid them                                                                                                       |
| 8          | A random character’s boots fall apart. They suffer 1 level of Fatigue due to exposure                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 9          | The path ahead is completely overgrown with thorny vines, reducing the party’s pace to 2 hexes                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10         | The group stumbles into some swampy muck or quicksand. Each character must make an Acrobatics check (TN 12) to avoid sinking to their death in the quicksand. Failure requires an Athletics check (TN 12 the first try, TN 14 the second try, TN 18 the third try). Failure means death |
