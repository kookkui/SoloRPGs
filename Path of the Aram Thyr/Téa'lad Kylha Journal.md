I make my way to the market and find a merchant willing to buy some of the loot I have brought back. He is will get to take them off my hands for 50% of the worth and I will take it at this point. Can't be too picky these days.

**Selling:**

- Gems worth 234 sp

Total = + 267 sp

Buying:
- 10 Rations  1 sp
-  Rope 25' 1 sp
- Tent 5 sp
- Lantern 10 sp
- Oil
- Void Case (10 Spirit Essences) 100 sp

Total = 117sp (153)
