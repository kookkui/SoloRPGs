**Maneuvers:** instead of performing a standard attack, characters can choose to use one of the following maneuvers as an action:
- **Charge**: You can move up to your full Speed and make a melee attack, but youâ€™re unable to dodge or parry until the start of your next turn. 
-  **Create Opening**: After a successful attack, a character can choose to deal half damage in order to grant +20 to the next attack against the same target, regardless of who performs it. This maneuver must be declared before attacking.
- **Disarm**: As an action, a character can attempt to disarm their opponent by performing a Dexterity opposed check. 
- **Wide Swing**: The character performs a standard attack modified by -20, attempting to hit not only the target but any other enemy combatant within 5 ft of them. Each targeted character may attempt to dodge or parry as normal, and the damage total is spread among all eligible targets.
- **Disengage**: You attempt to disengage from melee combat, performing a Dodge check. If you fail, any opponent at melee distance can perform a free attack of opportunity.
