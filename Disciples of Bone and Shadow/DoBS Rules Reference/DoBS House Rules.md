#### Tyrants

Tyrants are unquestionably the most feared creatures in the whole of the Fractured Dominion. According to legend, it was them who brought the world to its knees, nearly destroying it in the process. Bearing unrivaled power, they rule the land and although revolutions against them and their agents are frequent, very few change anything at all. It is only through the machinations of rival Tyrants that change happens, as they place a puppet in place of their defeated rival. Although semi-benign Tyrants do exist, the majority act without concern for anybody or anything. When your characters encounter a Tyrant, roll on the Elite Enemy Table. The Tyrant will have the stats and abilities of the resulting creature with some additional abilities unique to Tyrants. On each of the Tyrant's turns, roll a D10. On a 1-3 it will cast one of the following spells instead of performing a normal attack.
