**Maneuvers:** instead of performing a standard attack, characters can choose to use one of the following maneuvers as an action:
- **Charge**: You can move up to your full Speed and make a melee attack, but youâ€™re unable to dodge or parry until the start of your next turn. 
-  **Create Opening**: After a successful attack, a character can choose to deal half damage in order to grant +20 to the next attack against the same target, regardless of who performs it. This maneuver must be declared before attacking.
- **Disarm**: As an action, a character can attempt to disarm their opponent by performing a Dexterity opposed check. 
- **Wide Swing**: The character performs a standard attack modified by -20, attempting to hit not only the target but any other enemy combatant within 5 ft of them. Each targeted character may attempt to dodge or parry as normal, and the damage total is spread among all eligible targets.
- **Disengage**: You attempt to disengage from melee combat, performing a Dodge check. If you fail, any opponent at melee distance can perform a free attack of opportunity.

#### Tyrants

Tyrants are unquestionably the most feared creatures in the whole of the Fractured Dominion. According to legend, it was them who brought the world to its knees, nearly destroying it in the process. Bearing unrivaled power, they rule the land and although revolutions against them and their agents are frequent, very few change anything at all. It is only through the machinations of rival Tyrants that change happens, as they place a puppet in place of their defeated rival. Although semi-benign Tyrants do exist, the majority act without concern for anybody or anything. When your characters encounter a Tyrant, roll on the Elite Enemy Table. The Tyrant will have the stats and abilities of the resulting creature with some additional abilities unique to Tyrants. On each of the Tyrant's turns, roll a D10. On a 1-3 it will cast one of the following spells instead of performing a normal attack.

|2|Hellfire: This spell deals D50 damage to the characters, split evenly.|
