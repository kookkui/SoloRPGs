On top of it, you see the remains of several individuals, all of them partially mummified but still wearing traditional Blackclay garments and jewelry. This is holy ground for the blackclay tribes, and somehow not even the wild beasts seem to have approached the corpses. You may choose to loot the bodies, for a total of D10x100 jats

Next Hex 
**The Hag**. As you make progress through these lonely lands, you interrupt yourself when you see an old woman sitting by, looking at you. You approach her and she simply smiles at you and starts telling you about her lost nephew. For some reason you feel obliged to listen to her, but as her story progresses you start to feel uncomfortable, shadows flickering around you. Perform a WIL test, if you fail you earn 2 CP, but gain 2 points in Forbidden Lore. Either way, you pass out and when you wake up five minutes later the hag is gone

Library. This room was previously some sort of library. Now piles of half- rotten tomes gather dust in every corner, collapsed shelves creating a landscape of lost knowledge.

They must first pass a Literacy roll; if they do so roll a 5 : 1-2 a tome describing the terrors of an ancient civilization that worshiped the Primordial Ones.
