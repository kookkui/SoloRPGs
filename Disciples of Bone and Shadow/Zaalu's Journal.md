**The Hag**. As you make progress through these lonely lands, you interrupt yourself when you see an old woman sitting by, looking at you. You approach her and she simply smiles at you and starts telling you about her lost nephew. For some reason you feel obliged to listen to her, but as her story progresses you start to feel uncomfortable, shadows flickering around you. Perform a WIL test, if you fail you earn 2 CP, but gain 2 points in Forbidden Lore. Either way, you pass out and when you wake up five minutes later the hag is gone
