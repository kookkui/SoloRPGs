| 6-7        | **Cave**. A half-visible trail leads the party to a seemingly natural cave. If the party decides to explore it, use the Indoor Location generation rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8-9        | **Ruins**. You come across the abandoned remnants of a bygone era. If you choose to explore it use the Indoor Location generation rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10-11      | **Settlement**. You stumble upon a small community. Use the Settlement rules found on page 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12         | **Noble Hunter**. As you walk through the vast planes, sprinkled here and there by farmland and cattle, a splash of color draws your attention. A few feet further ahead you find a corpse, dressed in luxurious red and yellow clothes. It's been here for a while now, as it doesn't even smell. Beside it, you find a well crafted wooden bow, and inside a leather quiver a single, iron-tipped arrow. This arrow deals +10 extra damage                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13         | **Justice**. The smell of smoke is the first thing you notice before you can see, not that further away, the light of a big fire illuminating the dark sky. As you approach it, you get a better idea of what's going on: a regiment of Dusk Blades are surrounding a village, setting ablaze all the houses there. The villagers are all standing outside the village, staring at the soldiers as their houses are destroyed. If you ask around, you learn that apparently the village was built without an official permit and therefore it had no right to be built there                             |
| 14         | **Abandoned Farmstead**. Although the region has seen many new farms appear in order to feed the increasing population of Madari, this one over here seems to have been abandoned not that long ago. Crops are overgrown by weeds and thorns, and some of the fences have already been torn down by wild animals. As you walk through the field you arrive at its center, where a half disinterred marble statue of a cadaveric man lies. A sense of dread invades you when you approach it, and you can see a few farming tools surrounding it as if the farmers had simply dropped it all and ran away |
| 15         | **Flower Field**. Flowers of all colors and shapes grow here, with many that you have never seen before. If you search for useful plants you'll find `dice:2D10` doses instead of the regular D10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 16         | **Hangman Tree**. A single tree stands in the middle of a field, its branches creaking by the weight of three bodies hanging from them, in different stages of decomposition. All bodies have been branded on the forehead with the sigil of Danag the Silent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17         | **The Clearfelling**. As you cross one of the few forested areas around Madari, you find an opening caused by someone having fallen dozens of trees, judging by all the tree stumps. In the middle of the clearing though, a single, ancient-looking tree stands tall, its lush branches waiving slightly due to the breeze. Hanging from the tree you find `dice:D20` pieces of fruit; each piece counts as a day's ration                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18         | **Burial Mound**. A single, imposing burial mound stands in front of you, with a tunnel allowing you to access it. Upon closer inspection, it is clear the tunnel was dug from the inside out, and once inside your suspicions are confirmed as you find no corpse whatsoever. Instead, you find a single, dead raven, placed where the corpse once was, its wings spread wide. You also find several almost worthless little gems and amulets, for a total of 50 jats                                                                                                                                   |
| 19         | **Travelers**. A group of travelers is ahead in the road, their belongings hauled on the back of overworked horses and donkeys. One of them notices you and warns the others, who stand and stare at you with suspicion. They have nothing to share but their story: a great beast came and destroyed their little house, which was the last straw for the family elder, who decided the family would find a better fortune in the streets of Madari                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20         | **Rift**. As you advance through this quiet and gloomy land, dark thoughts in your mind, a sudden burst of light startles you. A few feet away the air seems to be shimmering with a bright but at the same time dark light; as the light spreads, advancing in a way that reminds you of blood seeping from an open wound, a set of monstrous tentacles burst from within it, attempting to grab you. You must succeed at 3 DEX test; for each one you fail you are dragged closer to the rift, which closes after 5 attempts, the tentacles disappearing on the other side with you or without you     |

Use the Settlement rules found on page 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12         | **Tree**. A single, twisted tree stands on top of a small hill ahead. When you approach it, its vibrant red flowers immediately draw your attention; their intense fragrance captivates you almost as much as their bright color, giving you a sensation of peace and belonging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13         | **Nest**. Woven with tree trunks and large vines, a nest big enough to hold several people rests against a small rock formation ahead of you. Approaching it with caution, you find the remains of three enormous eggs, cracked shell pieces flooring the nest's bottom. Perform a Perception skill test, if you succeed you find `dice:D10` precious gemstones worth 50 jats each scattered between the shells                                                                                                                                            |
| 14         | **Open Burial Site**. In front of you lies a large slab of polished stone, surrounded by now extinguished bonfires. On top of it, you see the remains of several individuals, all of them partially mummified but still wearing traditional Blackclay garments and jewelry. This is holy ground for the blackclay tribes, and somehow not even the wild beasts seem to have approached the corpses. You may choose to loot the bodies, for a total of `dice:D10x100` jats                                                                                  |
| 15         | **Pool** of Liquid Metal. As you approach what looks like a volcanic vent, you hear the boiling and gurgling sound of a liquid. As you peer down the steep hole, you cannot believe what you see: a small lake of what appears to be pure liquid metal. There's enough here to shame the fortune of Danag himself! Getting down there and getting some of it out would be problematic, though...                                                                                                                                                           |
| 16         | **Fog**. A sudden bank of fog surrounds you, quickly slowing your pace. For some strange reason though you start feeling extremely drowsy, to the point where you're having serious trouble keeping your eyes open. Pass a WIL test, otherwise, you fall asleep right on the spot and wake up a day later, tired and wet but with the fog nowhere to be seen                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 17         | **Hallowed Land**. As you enter this patch of land, without any special features to distinguish it from the rest, you immediately feel as if a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders. Your mind is clear and the world seems a bit brighter. Any spell casting here causes no corruption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18         | **Caravan**. Ahead of you, you see what seems like the remains of a caravan. The carts are all covered with a fine layer of volcanic ash. Surrounding it, you find the skeletal remains of all the animals and humans that belonged to the caravan. Small, black spiders scurry about them, but no clear signs of violence are visible                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 19         | **The Hag**. As you make progress through these lonely lands, you interrupt yourself when you see an old woman sitting by, looking at you. You approach her and she simply smiles at you and starts telling you about her lost nephew. For some reason you feel obliged to listen to her, but as her story progresses you start to feel uncomfortable, shadows flickering around you. Perform a WIL test, if you fail you earn 2 CP, but gain 2 points in Forbidden Lore. Either way, you pass out and when you wake up five minutes later the hag is gone |
| 20         | **Goat Herd**. Even before you can see them, you hear them right ahead; the unmistakable balling of goats, in the hundreds. In the middle of the herd, a single man and his dog stand, walking peacefully. If you approach him and pass a CHA test he will offer you guidance, allowing you to ignore the next negative result from a hex                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 9          | **Mysterious Figure.** As you progress through the ruins you can't help but feel observed. It's a nagging sensation in the back of your head that you can't get rid of. Your suspicions come to life though when you catch a glimpse of a hooded shadow several feet behind you, simply staring at you. Immediately after realizing it's been made though it quickly runs away. Any attempts at finding it again are completely futile; there's no trace of it to be found                                                                                                                            |

| 15         | **Alchemy Lab.** This room is filled with bottles, pipettes, and other tools that an alchemist would need. Everything here is covered in a thick layer of dust, but you find some notes that grant you +1 Alchemy if you spend a few hours studying them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 16         | **Library.** This room was previously some sort of library. Now piles of half- rotten tomes gather dust in every corner, collapsed shelves creating a landscape of lost knowledge. The party may spend a whole day here sifting through the books, hoping on even the slightest odds that there is something of worth. They must first pass a Literacy roll; if they do so roll a `dice:d6` : 1-2 a tome describing the terrors of an ancient civilization that worshiped the Primordial Ones. You gain +1 Forbidden Lore; 3-4 a random spell; 5-6 a treatise on local plants and herbs. +1 Herb Lore |
| 17         | **Intriguing mural.** A once vivid and colorful mural covers the whole wall in front of you. You immediately notice there's something off about it; some pieces seem to be out of place. To your surprise, you can easily slide them around and set them on what you believe to be the right place. Each character may attempt a Traditional Lore test to remember details about the story depicted in the mural and solve it. Solving the puzzle causes a small hidden compartment to open, revealing a small cache of jewels worth 100 jats                                                         |
| 18         | **Doorway.** As you advance through the ruins, your progress is halted due to a locked doorway. This profusely decorated archway is made of solid stone and has a series of carvings and frescoes on it, describing different scenes. Roll `dice:1d4`: 1 – The doorway will only open if heat is applied to it; 2 – The doorway will only open if the name of an ancient ruler written on it is spoken out loud. This requires a Literacy test; 3 – By casting a healing spell on it; 4 – By spilling fresh blood on it (2 HP)                                                                        |
| 19         | **Viewing Crystal.** A large, roughly shaped crystal stands on top of a pedestal. If touched, it will glow, revealing images of a strange place, filled with twisting spirals, skies carved in obsidian and raging oceans as black as the night sky. All characters present must pass a WIL test to avoid being enthralled by the vision, gaining 1 CP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 10         | **Canyon**. You find yourself walking through a canyon, its walls made of brittle sandy sediment. Strange plants grow from the cracks, gently swaying in the constant breeze that blows through this place, causing an eerie sound that reminds you of a wailing mother who has lost her only child                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11         | **Pilgrimage**. You come across a group of strange individuals dressed in tunics that cover them from head to toe. Six of them carry a huge statue of a faceless man on top of an ark, surrounded by food and flower offerings. Who are these people, and where are they headed to?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12         | **Magic Dead Zone**. For some reason, magic of any kind has no effect in this area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13         | **Rock-slide**. A sudden rock-slide forces you to act fast; each character must pass a DEX test to avoid being trapped under the rubble, unharmed but forced to look for another exit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 14         | **Waterfall**. A massive waterfall leads into a lagoon, blocking your way. If you want to get across you'll need to swim or find some other way. Pass D10 DEX tests to swim across                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 15         | **Settlement**. You stumble upon a small hidden community. Use the Settlement rules found on page 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16         | **Statue**. Half-visible through a heap of rubble older than time, the head of a giant statue, several times larger than you, stares blindly at you. A single man sits in front of it, its eyes closed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 17         | **Abandoned Campsite**. Someone has set camp here recently enough for you to take advantage of the place. You may set camp here without requiring an Outdoor Survival skill test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 18         | **Crystal Formation**. As you advance through the difficult terrain, you come across a strange crystal formation; they seem to glow ever so slightly with a blue light. As you approach them, the hairs on your neck stand up, and you can smell a strange sharp odor in the air. Touching them causes an electric discharge that deals 2D8 damage; if you survive and hold on to it you are able to pull a large piece. You may use it as a source of light that last 24 hours or sell it for 500 jats while still glowing, or 200 if not |
| 19         | **Voidstingers**. Before you realize it you are surrounded by a swarm of voidstingers. These minuscule insects burrow themselves into your eyes, granting you night vision for the next D20 hours and 1 CP, your vision flickering sometimes to a place of impossible geometry and gargantuan horrors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20         | **Fungi**. Covering a wall several feet tall, a mass of different colored fungi spreads like a shiny, wet blanket all over it. You may harvest D10 doses, each with a different effect; roll a D6 for each one of them: 1-2 a sensation of dread and anxiety invades you; 3-4 your nails turn black for D4 days but you feel a warmth invading your body, making you immune to cold effects; 5-6 heal D20 HP                                                                                                                               |
