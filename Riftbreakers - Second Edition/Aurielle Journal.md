Travel Check: Interesting Finds

A humanoid figure approaches you. As it comes closer, you realize that it appears to be some sort of construct woven from lightning and crystal shards. It mimics one of the party member’s movements perfectly, following for a while. If disturbed, it attacks (use the Crystal Construct profile, with all attacks dealing Lighting damage).

Oracle check "Do I disturb the construct?" 

Yes, but A new character(s), or an existing character’s true nature, is revealed (reinforcements appear, a harmless NPC is actually an enemy agent, etc.)

```statblock
creature: Crystal Construct

```encounter
creatures:
  - Crystal Construct , 25, 6, 0
