description: "These slithering monstrosities are as large as they are ancient. Lurking and waiting in the shadows for their next meal, they'll not hesitate to attack almost any living thing that crosses their way. Although capable of moving at very high speeds, they prefer to wait for their prey to pass near their hiding place, instead of chasing them down, although there are stories of horses having been run down by a ravenous enough giant snake."
