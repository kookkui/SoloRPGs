description: "A walking humanoid creature covered in thick fur, an Agrix is a sight few can tell they have survived. Possessed by an unstoppable blood-lust, an Agrix may be peacefully walking one moment and rushing to kill any living thing the second they notice it. They are completely relentless, vicious killing machines that will only stop when dead."
