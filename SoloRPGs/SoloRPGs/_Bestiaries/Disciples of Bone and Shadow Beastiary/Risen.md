description: "It is commonly said that the wandering dead far surpass the number of the living in the Whiteteeth Peninsula. Reanimated by accident or intentionally, these once- human creatures attack viciously any living thing that crosses their path. Many of the dead at sea return to the land of the living years after, some say trying to reunite with their loved ones, a will stronger than death."
