|---|---|
|1|Strange, four-winged creatures circle high above.|
|2|A pack of lupine creatures follow the crew for a while, before losing interest.|
|3|Two very large creatures battling up in the sky.|
|4|Snarls and growls can be heard around the crew, before dying off.|
|5|A herd of very large creatures, seemingly heading your way, which turn away at the last moment.|
|6|Bones litter the area, most of them ancient but some more than a few days old.|
|7|A large standing stone covered with deep claw marks.|
|8|A haunting, ululating howl can be heard not too far away|
|9|An enormous creature, dozens of feet tall, wanders near the crew and either ignores them or simply doesn’t notice them.|
|10|Thousands of small creatures burrow out from the ground, surrounding the crew before simply moving away from the area as fast as they can.|
|11|The remains of a large creature, partially devoured, block the path forward. It’s a fresh kill—whatever took this thing down is likely nearby.|
|12|Fresh tracks, like those of a large snake, crisscross ahead.|
|13|Tentacle-like appendages burst up around the crew, missing them by mere inches.|
|14|A wailing creature with dozens of small, extremely long legs runs ahead of the crew, chased by a lizard-looking beast.|
|15|A crew member unknowingly steps on some sort of fungal growth. Seconds after the crew moves ahead, a cloud of spores explodes behind them with a violent burst.|
|16|A swarm of extremely delicate creatures suddenly surrounds the crew, momentarily blinding them. As they collide with the crew, they burst and dye all their gear and suits a bright pink.|
|17|Whisper-like sounds surround the crew, their source impossible to pinpoint.|
|18|A few feet ahead of the crew’s current path, a single burst of laser fire leaves a scorched mark on the soil.|
|19|A blood-chilling roar freezes the crew in place, lasting several seconds and echoing across the landscape.|
|20|A large creature, 10’ long and with a menacing horned head, lies dead ahead. Upon close inspection, the cause of death is, without a doubt, firearm wounds. It seems recent.|

| 1-4        | A particularly interesting geological formation. Procedure dictates you must spend a whole Time Track documenting your findings, but you will be compensated with 25 DC once you return. |
| 5-7        | A fascinating mineral growth. Taking the appropriate samples and videos takes +1 TU and is worth 20 DC.                                                                                  |
| 8-9        | An Àrsaidh monument. There are no clues as to its meaning, if it ever meant anything to begin with. Careful documentation takes +3 TU and is worth a bonus of 25 DC.                     |
