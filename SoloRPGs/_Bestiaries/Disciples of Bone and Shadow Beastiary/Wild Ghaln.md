description: "Ghalns are the backbone of many societies in the Whiteteeth Peninsula, especially in Shadowstretch. Although domesticated Ghalns are docile, gentle beasts, their wild cousins are highly territorial. Generally living in small herds dominated by an alpha male, when faced with a thread the females and small ones will run away, while the male ones will charge without hesitation. Their rough skin allows them to face predators that otherwise would have no problem dealing with these (usually) calm creatures."
