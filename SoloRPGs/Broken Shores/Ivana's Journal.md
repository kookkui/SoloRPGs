A solitary tower, ascending from the depths of the sea. This was once a lighthouse, or perhaps a fortress’ watchtower; regardless of its original function, enough of it remains above the water to make it worth exploring. Use the ruin generation rules if you choose to take a look inside, the tower has a fixed small (D6) size.
