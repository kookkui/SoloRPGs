### Underground Cave System: Overall Description

|`dice:d20`|Underground Cave System: Overall Description|
|---|---|
|1|A large mausoleum that houses the remains of a draconic civilization|
|2|An intricate cave system that appears to be the result of lava digging through the earth|
|3|A cave system dug into black ice, cold to the touch but hard as stone|
|4|This place is made of great pillars of salt and quartz walls|
|5|An underground city, hastily built, with low ceilings and rough features|
|6|A clean, organized network of tunnels that probably formed part of some sort of transport system|
|7|A huge cavern, the ceiling lost in the darkness up above. Small craters form something akin to natural rooms and passageways within it|
|8|Construct remnants are everywhere, and the tunnels themselves seem to be made of construct parts|
|9|Large mushrooms grow everywhere, the walls and floors are covered in a layer of squishy mold|
|10|All tunnels and rooms here are made of large blocks of stone, making you feel as if you’re inside a vast ancient pyramid or ziggurat|
|11|Organic tissue covers every surface, with large, palpitating organs protruding in some places|
|12|The place is clearly an old, abandoned mine, the marks of pickaxes still visible on every surface|
|13|This place is hewn of pure emerald, the precious stone orbing the light of your torches and casting it back tenfold|
|14|Every surface of this tunnel network is covered in carefully stacked bones of all shapes and sizes|
|15|Every tunnel, room and chamber here seem to have been dug for creatures who were several times taller than any human, making you feel small and powerless|
|16|The tunnels and chambers of this place are all dug through the trunk of a single, giant tree|
|17|The walls, floors and ceilings of this place are all made of a substance that looks like clouds and is extremely soft. It’s completely impervious to damage and cannot be penetrated, though|
|18|Every surface is covered in an oily, non-flammable substance that reeks of old cheese|
|19|The tunnels and rooms of this place are all made of twine and laced branches and wigs, making it look like a giant bird’s nest|
|20|Large, spacious hallways and echoing, beautifully crafted chambers give you the feeling of being inside some sort of palace|
