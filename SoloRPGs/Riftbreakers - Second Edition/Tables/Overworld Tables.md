|     2      | A small, hidden stream surrounded by fruit-bearing trees.                                                                     |
|     3      | An ancient, crumbling stone bridge spanning a narrow ravine.                                                                  |
|     4      | A mysterious, ivy-covered ruin.                                                                                               |
|     5      | A small, abandoned hunting lodge.                                                                                             |
|     6      | An overgrown, abandoned stone road winding through the forest.                                                                |
|     7      | An ancient, moss-covered statue in a secluded glade.                                                                          |
|     8      | A bandit camp.                                                                                                                |
|     9      | Ghostly apparitions, enacting some sort of ritual.                                                                            |
|     10     | A group of hunters who say are being hunted by a pack of monsters.                                                            |
|     11     | An ancestor tree, slowly wandering across the forest.                                                                         |

|     13     | A party of Strangers, hunting after some high Rank monster.                                                                   |
|     14     | An old hermit who has lived in the forest for decades.                                                                        |

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | The fog thickens unnaturally, forming ghostly faces that murmur forgotten names. Anyone who listens must pass a Tenacity check or suffer D6 Psychic damage, as they’re haunted by visions of the forest’s past victims.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2          | A majestic stag with antlers of twisted silver and eyes like polished obsidian watches the party. If followed, it leads to a hidden glade with a magic pool containing water that restores D6 Health, but the water is guarded by a territorial Mossy Horror (page XXX). PCs can fill any container with this water if they want to take some with them, but its effects only work on the same character once each 24 hours. |
| 3          | A clearing littered with animal skeletons arranged in cryptic patterns. Disturbing them summons a Shade Stalker (page XXX). A Reason check reveals the bones are an offering to a long-dead druid’s spirit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4          | The undergrowth writhes with vine blights; avoiding them requires an Agility check. Failure to do so causes 2D4 Slashing damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5          | A cloaked figure with no face beneath its hood asks for directions in a hollow voice. If aided, it gifts a cursed silver coin (grants +5 to Perception but whispers lies at night). If attacked, it vanishes, leaving only a pile of wet leaves.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6          | Crumbling stone arches hum with a faint melody. Touching them triggers a vision of Kar Helos as it stood thousands of years ago, with a road connecting it to the Labyrinth, but they take D4 Psychic damage from the psychic echo.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7          | A Spectral Panther stalks the party. It flees if wounded but steals one random item first. Retrieving it requires tracking it to its den with a successful Survival check. Aside from the stolen item, you find a random magic item among the bones.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 8          | You find a moss-covered altar that holds a rusty dagger and fresh blood. Taking the dagger attracts a Grove Guardian (page XXX). Leaving an offering of blood (-5 Health), coin (-100⟑) or a magic item grants Advantage on all Survival checks for the next D4 days. The dagger is a magical one with 1 random property.                                                                                                    |
| 9          | You come across a giant oak with a gaping maw-like hollow. The hollow isn’t wide enough to stick your hand into it, but you can see something inside. A successful Athletics check allows you to open it, though. Roll on the Random Findings table.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10         | A ring of skulls hangs from the branches above, their jaws chattering in the wind. A successful Perception check spots a trap: stepping inside the circle summons Cinder Horrors (page XXX) that burst from the ground to drag victims under.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 11         | A pixie with moth wings flying at dazzling speed suddenly halts in front of you, offering a deal: a golden acorn (recover D20 Health when consumed) in exchange for a memory. If you accept, you forget your own name for the next week.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12         | A plant with crimson sap pulses like a heart in a clearing ahead. Harvesting it (requires a Gathering check) yields a potion (+20 to Athletics check for 1 hour). Uprooting it without care angers a nearby Ancient Tryam (page XXX) that mistakes the party for poachers.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 13         | Silent figures in tattered robes glide past you, carrying a coffin. Interrupting them curses the party with dread (-10 to Tenacity check for 24 hours). A Reason check recognizes them as priests of a forgotten god; their burial site might be nearby and may hold valuable relics.                                                                                                                                        |
| 14         | A Beastman (page XXX) with broken tusks charges you, covered in bloody thorns. It’s fleeing an unseen hunter. If spared, it leads to its lair: a cave with a wounded ranger who begs for help getting back to civilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 15         | A patch of mist shimmers with a floating stone archway; it appears to be a temporary portal to Kar Helos. IF you step through it, you find yourself in the Strangers District, but the portal closes behind you.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 16         | You come across a burned-out campsite with 3 charred skeletons. One of them is clutching a journal. Reading it reveals they were slain by their own greed: a cursed idol that still lies in the ashes. Taking it afflicts the carrier with nightmares for the next D10 Travel Days that reduce their Tenacity and Reason by 30, but allows them to start every combat with +1 Aether.                                        |
| 17         | A crone with bark-like skin offers you her herbal cures (D4 doses, heals D6 Health) in exchange for your hair or blood (start your next fight with the Dazed (2) condition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 18         | A sinkhole up ahead exhales a keening wind. You can attempt to climb down with an Athletics check; the hole is 20 meters deep. At the bottom, you find a statue of a wolf-headed creature worth 200⟑.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19         | An Island Golem (page XXX) stands in front of you motionless, covered in vines. You can attempt to sneak past it via a Stealth check. Failure activates it, and it attacks immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20         | A fogbank parts to reveal a crystalline tree radiating warmth. Touching it grants a vision of the forest’s origin—and a geas: “Protect the wilds or wither”. Accepting grants +20 Tenacity while in the forest; refusing summons a Grove Guardian (page XXX).                                                                                                                                                                |

| 2          | A group of miners, looking for a new vein.                                                                              |

| 6          | A group of hunters, seeking rare game to sell in Kar Helos.                                                             |

| 9          | A group of miners who claim have uncovered an ancient tomb.                                                             |

|`dice:d20`|Noteworthy Encounters - Bonespire Peaks|
|---|---|
|1|A cluster of cobalt-blue rocks hums in the wind. Touching them grants a vision of a rich mineral deposit just a few dozen meters away. Finding it takes no effort, and a successful Gathering check nets D4 rolls on the Type of Mineral Deposit table (page XXX). Unfortunately, it also awakens an Earth Elemental (page XXX) that considers the rocks sacred.|
|2|A shivering hermit in tattered robes points to the sky, babbling about “the spire that drinks blood”. He refuses to elaborate, but his words leave you feeling uncertain about the future: make a Tenacity check, or suffer Disadvantage on all actions for the next 24 hours.|
|3|A collapsed mine shaft exhales a moaning wind. Inside, spectral miners (stats as Spectral Wraith, page XXX) repeat their final moments. Defeating them reveals a twisted, knotted pickaxe. This is a Rare magic item, treat it as a two-handed axe and determine its properties randomly.|
|4|A meteorite streaks across the sky, crashing into a nearby peak. Locating it reveals a core of Silver (D4 pieces) and Iron (D6 pieces).|
|5|A lost traveler stumbles down the pass, pursued by Obsidian Vultures (page XXX). He is willing to join the party as a Companion, if saved.|
|6|The mountain’s surface here is streaked with crimson fissures. Chipping at them releases a parasitic mist: all party members must pass an Endurance check or be Poisoned (2). The pieces broken free turn into what looks like rubies, worth 2D100⟑.|
|7|A wrecked ore cart has spilled its contents across the mountain trail Among them you find D4 black diamonds worth D100⟑ each.|
|8|A narrow pass is spanned by a bridge built from fused skeletons. Crossing it requires a Tenacity check to ignore the whispers; failure causes D4 spectral hands to emerge and grapple the character, who must pass an Athletics check to avoid losing 3D4 Health.|
|9|The clouds coalesce into a gigantic face that howls with thunder. A Survival check allows the party to find shelter before the sudden storm strikes at them; failure means lightning strikes (6 Lightning damage, Agility check to avoid) follow and strike at the party each time they enter a new hex for the next D4 hexes.|
|10|A seemingly crazed prospector digs at a bare cliff, insisting “it’s right here!”. His pick strikes something metallic, and the rock face bleeds as a result.|
|11|Three albino ravens perch on a cairn, staring unnervingly. If followed (Nature check), they lead to a sacrificial pit where miners once left offerings. The pit contains D3 preserved corpses with golden eyes (worth 50⟑ each).|
|12|The ground trembles, triggering a rockfall. An Agility check is required to avoid the falling rocks, which deal D6 Bludgeoning damage if hit. In the aftermath, a fissure reveals a hidden cave with ancient murals of people worshipping a mountain-sized worm. A successful Perception check reveals a miner’s hidden stash with D6|
|13|Precious Gems (page XXX).|
|14|A strange gust of wind guides you towards a cave mouth. Inside, you find a swirling vortex; tossing into it 20⟑ appeases it, granting you Advantage on Initiative checks for the next 24 hours.|
|15|A scout’s corpse is lashed to a peak, wrapped in runed parchment. The parchment can be tied around one’s waist, working as an Uncommon magic belt.|
|16|A hidden trail leads you towards a small cave. Inside, you find a small locked chest (Lockpicking check to open). Opening allows rolling on the Random Findings table.|
|17|A mining crew returning to Kar Helos offers to share their fire. They tell stories of tunnels going deep enough to reach an area that rumor says connects directly to the Labyrinth.|
|18|The highest peak in the vicinity exhales a plume of green mist. Unfortunately, a sudden change in the wind pushes the green cloud in your direction: all characters must make an Endurance check, or suddenly vomit a handful of gemstones, losing D10 Health in the process but obtaining D4 emeralds.|
|19|A skeletal figure in molten gold armor staggers from a mine, clutching a pickaxe fused to its hand. It ignores everyone, unless attacked. If attacked, use the Mummy Guardian profile (page XXX). Its armor is worth 200⟑.|
|20|A vertical shaft plunges into darkness, its walls lined with beating veins. Climbing down (requires an Athletics check, the shaft is 200 meters deep) leads to a chamber where a massive heart pulses, suspended by chains. Killing the heart grants +1 Athletics permanently, but the mountains tremble in pain. You feel there will be consequences to this act.|

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1          | A lightning-scarred mystic from the Crystal Clan warns of an  approaching tempest. If the party shelters with them, they offer D4 charged crystal shards (Consumable: deal D6 Lighting damage).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2          | A 5O-meter crystal pillar vibrates with a haunting hum. Touching it  forces a Tenacity check; failure transfixes the victim for D4 hours as they experience visions of the Plains’ creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3          | A blind elder sits atop a cracked crystal, offering prophecies in  exchange for “a piece of your storm” (D6 Health in blood). Use the Action & Theme tables to generate the prophecy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4          | A Stormwolf stalks the party, but doesn’t engage. Attacking it causes it to howl, summoning D4 more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5          | A field of delicate crystal flowers that shatter under your steps,  releasing a hallucinogenic dust (Endurance check to resist). Those affected by it see shadowy figures dancing in the storm, and spend the next DIO hours entranced by it.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6          | A perfectly spherical crystal the size of an apple (worth 5Oa) pulses with light. Carrying it for more than an hour causes static hair and metallic tastes, but other than that it’s harmless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 7          | Spectral aurochs stampede through your camp. They pass  harmlessly through objects and people, creating a confusing but spectacular scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 8          | A Crystal Hunter challenges a party member to a ritual duel:  standing atop a crystal during a storm. In order to win the duel, the PC must pass 5 Tenacity checks. The loser is Blinded for D4 days; the winner earns a storm forged weapon (epic magic weapon, roll for properties).                                                                                                                                         |
| 9          | A recent lighting strike reveals a gigantic crystal hand protruding  from the earth. Digging it further exposes a petrified giant with  living lightning in its veins. PCs can attempt an Endurance check to imbue their weapons with it, dealing an additional D6 Lighting  damage for the next 2 weeks.                                                                                                                      |
| 10         | A whirlwind of crystal shards hovers menacingly. It appears to  consume lightning to grow larger. Feeding it (e.g., with a Lightning Strike spell) earns its temporary blessing, increasing your travel  speed through the Crystal Plains by +I hex.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11         | A collapsed watchtower of blackened crystal stands amid scorch  marks. For reasons that escape you, the watchtower appears to have been struck multiple times by lighting, until nothing but rubble  remains. A successful Perception check allows you to find something of interest among the rubble, though: roll on the Random Findings  table.                                                                             |
| 12         | A pool of electrified water restores D6 to those who drink it, but for the next 24 hours each time they wield any metal item (such as a  sword) they suffer D6 Lighting damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13         | A humanoid figure approaches you. As it comes closer, you realize  that it appears to be some sort of construct woven from lightning  and crystal shards. It mimics one of the party member’s movements perfectly, following for a while. If disturbed, it attacks (use the  Crystal Construct profile, with all attacks dealing Lighting damage).                                                                             |
| 14         | A Clan child approaches you, begging for help finding their storm- sibling, a sort of clan family member that falls between cousin and  uncle, for what you understand. The child says that they were last  seen chasing after a herd of deer. He has nothing to offer in  exchange for your aid, but he knows that the clan will be immensely thankful if they are found.                                                     |
| 15         | A corpse fused to a crystal twitches to life as you approach it, its  veins glowing. It speaks in reverse speech, and a Reason check is  required to understand it. It appears to be revealing the location of a cache of Clan relics, not far from your current location. You must  travel I hex southwards to reach the spot, where you will fifind the  hidden cache. If you do so, roll once on the Random Findings table. |
| 16         | A ribbon of lighting dances between crystals, forming what appears to be runes. Interpreting them (requires a Reason check) reveals a hidden ley line nearby; If you camp at the ley line you will start your next fight with +5 Aether during the first round.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 17         | A war party approaches you, accusing you of trespassing. You can  either pay IOOA each and be forced to backtrack to the previous hex, or fight them. If you choose to fight, you will not be welcomed in any settlements you come across in all surrounding hexes; use the  Bandits profile (page XXX).                                                                                                                       |
| 18         | A IO-meter geode pulses with light. As you approach it, you see large cracks on its surface; so large, in fact, that you can peek inside. If you do, you see what appears to be some sort of  fossilized creature  clutching a wand (Consumable, has DIO charges of the Elemental  Heart’s Lightning Strikes Ability). Cracking the geode open requires a successful Hard (-20) Athletics check.                               |
| 19         | A localized cyclone hovers over a single crystal spire. Entering it  (requires an Athletics check, due to the strong winds) leads to the eye of the storm, where time appears to be moving slower (I hour inside = I minute outside). You can choose to camp here, which  allows you to move an additional hex during this Travel Day.                                                                                         |
| 20         | A colossal crystal 5O meters ahead of you hums with power.  Touching it forces a Tenacity check: if you fail, you immediately suffer 2D2O Lighting damage, but you become Resistant to Lightning damage. If you succeed, you steal a spark of the crystal’s power, allowing you to move an additional time during combat at no cost.                                                                                           |

|`dice:d20`|Interesting Encounters - Mudbloom Marsh|
|---|---|
|1|A patch of reeds sways against the wind, and you can almost hear  some words. A Reason check allows you to recognize it as a warning: a group of Drowned Ghouls (page XXX) lies ahead, and the warning  allows you to automatically surprise them.|
|2|A one-eyed trapper offers to guide the party—for a payment in  expertise (reduce a random Skill by D4). The guide allows the party to double their travel speed in the Marsh.|
|3|The ground becomes incredibly unstable, moving almost like a living thing. Each round, a random character must make an Agility check or sink D4 meters.|
|4|A will-o’-wisp mimics a fisherman's lantern, luring the party unless someone makes a Hard (-20) Perception check. Failing the check  causes the party to get lost, losing I Travel Day.|
|5|A primitive but effective trap is hidden among the reefs. Make a  Perception check to avoid stepping into it, suffering 2D6 Piercing damage if you fail.|
|6|A bio-luminescent lily pulses in the muck. Plucking it releases  hallucinogenic spores (Endurance Check to resist) that cause the party to spend an additional Travel Day here. The lily can be sold for 5OA.|
|7|A crone in a rotting boat demands a story as you pass her by. Refusal means she curses one weapon (-D4 damage until cleansed).|
|8|A bridge of fused skeletons spans a channel. Crossing requires a Tenacity check; failure means hearing the bones’ final moments, which causes D4 Psychic damage.|
|9|A slab of animated muck blocks the path, and the only way to have it open the path is to throw some metal at it, which it immediately  absorbs.|
|10|Mist parts to reveal rotting ships trapped in the reeds. A Reason check allows you to fix one of them, which you can use to travel an additional hex while on the Marsh.|
|11|A blue flame dances atop a stump. Its eerie light casts strange  shadows, playing tricks in your mind. A successful Reason check allows you to somehow learn from the experience, allowing you to increase D4 different Skills by I.|
|12|A metal flower grows from a corpse. Touching it forces a vision of the corpse’s death, pointing towards a nearby Rift.|
|13|A half sunk boat seems to have been hastily ransacked, but you still find a few baubles worth D20A.|
|14|A stone circle surrounds a pool of black water. Tossing in at least 50A summons a spirit, which will answer a single question truthfully.|
|15|You stumble upon a rambling madman, who babbles about “the Crawling Rot” infecting the marsh.|
|16|A crimson flower blooms in the middle of a small pool of black water. Eating its petals heals D8 Heath but causes vivid nightmares.|
|17|A rusted bell protrudes from the muck. You can dig it out with an  Athletics check, and ringing it immediately causes an opponent to run away. The bell disintegrates after being used once.|
|18|A small island of surprisingly solid and dry land immediately attracts your attention, as it looks like the best spot to camp you’ve seen in  days. Setting camp here grants you Advantage on all checks for the  next 24 hours, as you have the best sleep of your life.|
|19|A finishing village of barely 40 homes peaks among the reeds. This looks like a good spot for information or trading.|
|20|The marsh shudders For D6 rounds, the soil under your feet acts as  quicksand, forcing you to pass an Agility check to avoid being sucked in every round. Being trapped by quicksand requires passing an  Athletics check, or you will die from suffocation after DIO rounds if someone doesn’t help you. Surviving grants a scaly scar that itches near Rifts.|
