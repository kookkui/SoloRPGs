## Followers/Companions:

- Only one follower/companion of each type any given time.

- Each follower can be activated once per combat round or once per travel day in overland.

- Follower pay is 10 ⟑ per day but is only paid upon returning to Kar Helos. Days done as a return trip do not count. Effectively you're paying your followers per quest. Paying for the trip back feels financially unsustainable.

- Cleanser & Purifier merged as one follower. (the missing D20 value in its place is unknown)

- The Scout follower can suffer the consequences of a Rift Encounter danger. It dies as a result as you flee.

- Followers can hold torches for you.

- Follower Shield trait triggers after an encounter roll for its action but before any other rolls are done. Only works when the action is some sort of attack that deals damage. 

## Character sheet: 

- Doubles of any skill check adds +1 to the skill permanently pass or fail.

- Skill Books add +3 per successful Literacy check. Books do not disappear from inventory if failed.

- Hearts and Essences require a Rest event to learn. Can learn any number per Rest.

- Items not stored on the belt cannot be accessed during combat. One spare weapon can be put on a belt.

## Overland:

- When traveling overland each a **Survival check** must be preformed to be able to pick a direction. Failure results in having to use the `dice:[[SoloRPGs/Riftbreakers/Tables/General Tables#^c0cced]]` table.

- Resting requires a D10 check. On 7+ (6+ in a Rift) the rest is interrupted and an encounter is rolled. After the encounter, +1 fatigue is applied.

- Fleeing from combat forfeits any travel activities like Rest, Gathering, Survival. 

- Survival checks can be done once per travel day to gain x1 Ration. This check forfeits the option to do a Gathering check.

Survival Skill has the following terrain modifiers:
	Mountain -0
	Forest/Jungle +10
	Plains +5
	Desert - 15
	Swamp -10

## Encounters:

- Cutpurse Steal ability randomizes an item on your Belt slot and/or Aetheryte. Thematically your belt should always carry common items like potions, etc. If Aetheryte is triggered, you lose D4x10.
